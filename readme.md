# wp-compat

This work-in-progress repo will contain a collection of tools for checking and managing the WordPress version compatibility of plugins, themes, and other WordPress tooling.

Please don't open PRs or issues just yet, this is a brand new repo.

## Installation

```shell
composer require johnbillion/wp-compat
```

## Tools

### symbols.json

The [symbols.json](symbols.json) file contains a dictionary of all functions and methods in WordPress along with the version of WordPress in which they were introduced.

The file can be regenerated by running:

```shell
composer generate
```

The JSON schema for the file can be found in [schemas/symbols.json](schemas/symbols.json).

## Coming soon

* A PHPStan extension which determines if your code is compatible with any given version of WordPress based on the symbols that it uses.
* Possibly the same but for function and method parameter usage. Don't hold your breath though.
