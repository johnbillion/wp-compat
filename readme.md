## Tools

### PHPStan extension

A PHPStan extension which determines if your code is compatible with any given version of WordPress based on the symbols that it uses.

### symbols.json

The [symbols.json](symbols.json) file contains a dictionary of all functions and methods in WordPress along with the version of WordPress in which they were introduced.

The file can be regenerated by running:

```shell
composer generate
```

The JSON schema for the file can be found in [schemas/symbols.json](schemas/symbols.json).
